For Magos to work effectively, we recommend using a clear directory structure. This make you manage the states easier, and it's more scalable and maintainable.

## 📂 Suggested folder structure

Here's a common organizational structure in real-world projects:

import { File, Folder, Files } from "fumadocs-ui/components/files"

<Files> 
  <Folder name="src" defaultOpen> 
    <Folder name="store" defaultOpen> 
      <Folder name="boxes" defaultOpen> 
        <File name="counterBox.ts" />
        <File name="authBox.ts" /> 
        <File name="themeBox.ts" /> 
      </Folder> 
      <File name="store.ts" />
    </Folder> 
    <File name="main.ts" /> 
    <File name="App.tsx" /> 
  </Folder>
</Files>

### For Simple Vanilla JS projects

If you're building a project without a **framework** or **complex bundling tools**, you can follow the simplified structure below:

<Files>
  <Folder name="my-awesome-app" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="js" defaultOpen> 
    <Folder name="store" defaultOpen> 
      <File name="counterBox.js" /> 
      <File name="store.js" /> 
    </Folder> 
    <File name="main.js" />
  </Folder> 
    <File name="index.html" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

### ⚠️ Key Considerations for Vanilla:

* **Extensions**: Always use `.js` for your `files`.

* **Module Type**: When linking your JavaScript in `index.html`, remember to use `type="module"`:

```html
<script type="module" src="./js/app.js"></script>
```
* **Explicit Imports**: In a browser-native environment, you must **include** the **file extension** in your `import` statements:

```js
import { store } from "./store/store.js"; // Note the .js extension
```

---

## 📝 Role of each component

* `boxes/`: Contains the logical definitions for your state. Each file represents a specific domain of state (e.g., auth, counter, or theme) rather than putting everything in one place.

* `store.ts`: The central configuration file that combines all of your boxes into a unique, global store using `createStore`.

---

## 💡 Why should it be organized this way?

**Scalability**: Easily add 10 or 100 boxes **without messing up** the main file.

**Teamwork**: **Minimize code conflicts** when multiple team members are working on different features simultaneously.

**Readability**: By look at the `boxes/`, anyone can **instantly understand** which state domains are being managed in your app.

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
* Although Magos **dosen't force** you to follow this specific structure, this is the **recommend "Best Practice"** to keep your application **clean, organized** and **easy to maintain** as it grows.

* **For JavaScript user**: Magos is built with TypeScript but works perfectly in pure JavaScript environments. Simply change the file extensions from `.ts` to `.js` and remove the type declarations in the next tutorial.
