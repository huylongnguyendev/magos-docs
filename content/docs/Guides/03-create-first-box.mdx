description: How to create and use the Box

## What is the Box?

The `box` in **Magos** is a fundamental unit where you define your **State** and its associated **Actions**. It encapsulates logic and ensures that your data can only be modified in predictable ways.

import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs"

<Tabs items={["TypeScript", "JavaScript"]}>
  <Tab value="TypeScript"> 
    ```typescript
    import { createBox } from "magos";

    // 1. Initial state (can be number, string, object, or array)
    const initialState = 0;

    // 2. Create the Box with actions
    export const counterBox = createBox(initialState, (set) => ({
      inc: () => set((prev) => prev + 1),
      dec: () => set((prev) => prev - 1),
      reset: () => set(0),
}));
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="JavaScript"> 
    ```javascript 
    import { createBox } from "magos";

    // 1. Initial state (can be number, string, object, or array)
    const initialState = 0;

    // 2. Create the Box with actions
    export const counterBox = createBox(initialState, (set) => ({
      inc: () => set((prev) => prev + 1),
      dec: () => set((prev) => prev - 1),
      reset: () => set(0),
    }));
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout title="Important Note" type="warning">
  **For TypeScript User**: If your `initialState` uses **Complex Reference Types** (such as object, array, nested structures), it is highly recommended a specific type for it. This ensures full type-safety across your actions.

## What parameters does the `createBox` allow?

The `createBox` function is the **starting point** for most of your logic. To use it effectively, you nedd to understand **two primary parameters** it accepts:

### 1. The `initialState`

The `initialState` is the represents the dynamic data that your UI will display. While it looks like a normal variable, it is much more powerful because it is **reactive**.

To ensure **stability** and **predictable** Type Interface, the `createBox` accepts almost any value **except**:

  * `undefined`: State must always have a **starting value** to avoid runtime crashes.
  * Empty object `{}`: You should **define** the structure of your `object`, so Magos and TypeScript can **understand** the data shape from the start.

**Example**:

**🟢 Do**:

```js
  const userData = {
    user: [], // Empty Array had accepted
    loading: false
  }
  
  // #or

  const student = {
    name: ""
    age: 0, // or another default age you want
    email: "example@email.com"
    address: "",
  }
```

<Callout title="Tips" type="success">
  Even if you don't have data yet (e.g., waiting for an API), you should provide a `placeholder` structure. An **empty array** is a great way to tell Magos: "This will be a list."
</Callout>

**🔴 Don't**:

```js
  const userData = undefined
  
  // #or

  const student = {}

```

**⚠️ Can but Notice**:

```js
  const userData = {
    user: {}, // Empty Array had accepted
    loading: false
  }
  
  // #or

  const student = {
    name: undefined
    age: 0, // or another default age you want
    email: "example@email.com"
    address: "",
  }
```

<Callout title="Notic" type="warning">
  * **Nested Undefined/Empty Objects**: Having undefined or an empty object {} inside a nested property is acceptable. However, you should only use this when the incoming data structure is unpredictable or when you are certain you can manage the logic safely.

  * **Structure Integrity**: If you overwrite the state directly, you must ensure the new data maintains the same structure as the initialState to avoid breaking UI components or TypeScript contracts.
</Callout>

### 2. The `actionFactory`

The `actionFactory` is a function that returns an object containing all of actions. The `actions` are used to modify the `state`. To use the `actionFactory`, using the `set` keyword (callback function) to declare.

```js
  export const counterBox = createBox(initialState, (set) => ({
    //... write your actions here
  }));
```

<Callout title="Tips" type="success">
  **Magos** recommends using an `anonymous arrow function` for brevity. This is the designated place to define all your business logic and state transitions.
</Callout>

The `set` callback accepts only one parameter that is the latest `state`. **Magos** recommends using the `prev` keyword (functional update) to modify your `state` safely. This **always ensures** you are working with the most recent data.
