description: How to install the Magos into your Project
---

To install **Magos** into your project, you can use any of the major package managers. **Magos** is lightweight and designed to work seamlessly across different environments.

## 📦 **Installation**
Choose the command that matches your preferred package manager:

import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs"

<Tabs items={["pnpm", "npm", "yarn", "bun"]}>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add magos
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install magos
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add magos
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
    ```bash
    bun add magos
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Magos** is constantly evolving with better type inference and performance optimizations. To ensure you are using the latest features (like the new unbox API), run the following command:

<Tabs items={["pnpm", "npm", "yarn", "bun"]}>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add magos@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install magos@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add magos@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
    ```bash
    bun add magos@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## ⚙️ Requirements

Magos is designed to be modern and fast. To ensure the best experience, please check the following requirements:

* **TypeScript**: version 4.5+ (recommended for full type safety).

* **React**: version 18.0+.

* **Runtime**: Works in all modern browsers and Node.js environments.

## 🏗️ What's next?
Now that Magos is part of your project, you're ready to start structuring your state. We recommend following this path:

* **Create your first Box**: Learn how to define state and actions.

* **Setup a Store**: Combine multiple boxes into a single, organized store.

* **Connect to UI**: Choose between React or Vanilla JS to bring your state to life.

<Callout  title="Tips" type="success">
  Magos is tree-shakable. Only the parts you use `Vanilla` or `React` will end up in your final bundle!
