## What is a Store?

Once your application grows and you have **multiple boxes**, you need a centralized place to manage them. This is where the **Store** comes in.

The Store acts as a **Global Container** (or a "Master Archive") that gathers all your individual Boxes. It provides a unified interface for your UI to access any state or action from across your entire application.

**🧩 Why do you need a Store?**

* **Centralization**: Instead of importing 10 different boxes into one component, you just connect to the Store.
* **Organization**: It keeps your state architecture clean and scalable.
* **Coordination**: It allows different boxes to exist together in a single, manageable ecosystem.

### 1. Creating a Store

To create a Store, **Magos** provides a simple function called `createStore`. It takes an object where each key represents a name for your box, and the value is the Box instance itself.

```js
import { createStore } from "magos";
import { authBox } from "./authBox";
import { cartBox } from "./cartBox";

// The Store is a collection of your Boxes
export const store = createStore({
  auth: authBox,
  cart: cartBox
});
```

  * **The Keys matter**: The names you give here (e.g., auth, cart) will be the keys you use to access those boxes from the Store.
  * **Centralized Dispatch**: The Store automatically gathers all actions from your boxes, making them easy to trigger from anywhere.
  * **Single Source of Truth**: Even if you have 100 boxes, you only need to export this one store to power your entire app.

  The `createStore` accepts an object containing a **unique Box instance**.

### 2. How does the store work?

In the last guide, the `magos_id` was mentioned. You might wonder why it exists if you don't need to use it manually.

The **store** uses this Internal ID as a fingerprint for each Box. When you register your boxes in the `createStore`, the **store** scans the `magos_id` of each box to ensure there are no duplicates.
  
  * **Strict Validation**: If the object contains at least two duplicate boxes, createStore will throw an error to prevent state conflicts.
  * **Integrity**: If everything is unique, it returns the Store object, ready for use.

**Why is this great?**

Because **Magos** tracks boxes by their **internal IDs**, you don't need to worry about the variable name of the Box and the Key in the Store being the same. They are independent.


<Callout title="Note" type="info">
  You can also use the `boxes` independently, but if you have more than three boxes, you should use the store for better **control** and **maintainability**.
