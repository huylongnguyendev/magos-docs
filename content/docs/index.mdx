Welcome to Mago Docs!

## Introduction

Mago is a JS library for state management that **automatic**, **compact**, **scalable**, **maintainable**, and **easy-to-use**.

It helps you control states easily with concise code and operate a neat structure. Additionally, it helps you control data type safety and minimize errors.

<Callout title="Why Mago?" type="info">
  Mago was built to solve the complexity of large-scale state management while keeping the developer experience (DX) lightweight and intuitive.
</Callout>

## Key Features

* **Compact Structure**: No boilerplate, just focus on your logic.
* **Type Safety**: Built with TypeScript from the ground up.
* **Scalable**: Perfect for both small apps and large enterprise systems.

## Installation

Mago is available as a package on NPM. You can integrate it into your project using any of the major package managers:

import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs"

<Tabs items={["pnpm", "npm", "yarn", "bun"]}>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add mago
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install mago
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add mago
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
    ```bash
    bun add mago
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### First create new Box

`Box` is a concept used to declares `slice` in Mago. It checks and registers initial state and actions (action factory). Then it returns a function to get the new state, an action factory and a subcribe function.

```js
import { createBox } from "mago"

const initialState = 0

export const counterBox = createBox(initialState, (set) => ({
  inc: () => set(prev => prev + 1),
}))
```

### Then create a store

`Store` helps you register the boxes you create.

```js
import { createStore } from "mago"
import { counterBox } from "./boxes/counterBox"

export const store = createStore({
  counter: counterBox,
})
```

### Finally bind your components

You can use the hook anywhere without provider. Do you remember how to use `useState`? This question makes you imagine how Mago would use his hook, right? When your selected state changes, only the consuming components will re-render.

```js
function SheepCounter() {
  const [count] = useAppStore(store.counter)

  return <h1>`I have ${count} sheep on my farm`</h1>
}

function SheepCountAction() {
  const [,setCount] = useAppStore(store.counter)

  return <button onClick={setCount.inc}>Count</button>
}
```
