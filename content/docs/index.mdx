description: How to use Magos

Welcome to Magoss Docs!

## Introduction

Magos is a JS library for state management that **automatic**, **compact**, **scalable**, **maintainable**, and **easy-to-use**.

It helps you control states easily with concise code and operate a neat structure. Additionally, it helps you control data type safety and minimize errors.

<Callout title="Why Magos?" type="info">
  Magos was built to solve the complexity of large-scale state management while keeping the developer experience (DX) lightweight and intuitive.
</Callout>

## Key Features

* **Compact Structure**: No boilerplate, just focus on your logic.
* **Type Safety**: Built with TypeScript from the ground up.
* **Scalable**: Perfect for both small apps and large enterprise systems.

## Quick Start

You can start to use the Magos and setup quickly here.

### Installation

Magos is available as a package on NPM. You can integrate it into your project using any of the major package managers:

import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs"

<Tabs items={["pnpm", "npm", "yarn", "bun"]}>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add magos
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install magos
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add magos
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
    ```bash
    bun add magos
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### First create new Box

`Box` is a concept used to declares `slice` in Magos. It checks and registers initial state and actions (action factory). Then it returns a function to get the new state, an action factory and a subcribe function.

```js
import { createBox } from "magos"

const initialState = 0

export const counterBox = createBox(initialState, (set) => ({
  inc: () => set(prev => prev + 1),
}))
```
---

### Then create a store

`Store` helps you register and manage the boxes you created.

```js
import { createStore } from "magos"
import { counterBox } from "./boxes/counterBox"

export const store = createStore({
  counter: counterBox,
})
```

---

### Finally bind your components

#### For React

You can use the hook anywhere without `provider`. Do you remember how to use `useState`? This question makes you imagine how Magos would use his hook, right? When your selected state changes, only the consuming components will re-render.

```js
import { useAppStore } from "magos/react"
import { store } from "@/store/store"

function SheepCounter() {
  const [count] = useAppStore(store.counter)

  return <h1>`I have ${count} sheep on my farm`</h1>
}

function SheepCountAction() {
  const [,setCount] = useAppStore(store.counter)

  return <button onClick={setCount.inc}>Count</button>
}
```

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
  Do you remember how to use `useState`? This question alone helps you imagine how Magos works, right? 
</Callout>

#### For Vanilla

If you're using `Vanilla JS`, use the `unbox` method to automatically synchronize your state with DOM elements. It handles state selection, UI updates, and provides a cleanup mechanism.

```js
import { unbox } from "magos/vanilla"
import { store } from "@/store/store"

/**
 * 1. Synchronizing State to UI
 * Magos will automatically update the #sheep-display content
 */
export function setupSheepCounter() {
  const element = document.querySelector("#sheep-display")

  // unbox returns [state, actions, unsubscribe]
  const [, , unsub] = unbox(
    store.counter, 
    element, 
    (state) => `I have ${state} sheep on my farm`
  )

  // Call unsub() to stop updates when the element is removed
  return unsub 
}

/**
 * 2. Handling Actions
 * Access actions directly to bind events to your UI
 */
export function setupSheepCountAction() {
  const element = document.querySelector("#count-button")
  
  // We just need to get the actions for handling events
  const [, actions] = unbox(store.counter, element)

  const handleIncrement = () => actions.inc()
  element.addEventListener('click', handleIncrement)

  // Clean up both the Event Listener and the Unbox subscription
  return () => {
    element.removeEventListener('click', handleIncrement)
    unsub() // Always clean up to prevent memory leaks!
  }
}
```
